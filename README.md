# H1N1 FLU VACCINATION PREDICTION: A Machine Learning Project

## Project Overview

TThe goal of this project is to leverage the data collected in the National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey to predict whether individuals received the H1N1 flu vaccine. By understanding the factors influencing personal vaccination patterns, we aim to provide valuable insights that can guide public health efforts. The analysis will focus on uncovering the relationships between individuals' backgrounds, opinions, and health behaviors and their decisions regarding flu vaccination. The project aims to contribute to the ongoing efforts to vaccinate the global population against infectious diseases and viruses, such as the recent viral outbreak of COVID-19, with a particular focus on the experiences from the H1N1 flu outbreak in 2009.

## Stakeholder Understanding

Assist public health officials seeking insights into vaccination patterns and aid various stakeholders interested in optimizing vaccine distribution strategies.

## Data Source

The data for this project is sourced from the National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey, consisting of information related to 26, 707 individuals' backgrounds, opinions, and health behaviors during the H1N1 flu outbreak. The dataset encompasses a diverse set of features, including demographic information, socio-economic status, health-related attitudes, and behaviors. The primary focus of the dataset is to understand the factors influencing personal vaccination patterns for the H1N1 flu vaccine.
